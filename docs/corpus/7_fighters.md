<h2>7. Fighters</h2>

7.1 Fighters gain a bonus to all combat-related checks equal to their level. (Among the combat-related checks we count the initiative roll, all attack and defence rolls, and injury saves.)

<h3>Precedents for fighter-exclusive initiations</h3>

7.2 _Tough fucker_: you roll d8 hit dice instead of d6, and you can keep your last hit point total after re-rolling instead of having to take the new value.

7.3 _Tactician_: you are keen-eyed and thoughtful as a fighter. When in a fight you get one free "tactical" each combat round. This action can be used for e.g. awareness checks to deduce the opponents' abilities or plans, or shouting orders.

7.4 _Berserk_: you are probably a barbarian of some sort. You can go berserk in a fight to gain +2 to hit in direct, savage mêlée. Berserking takes a few minutes pre-battle, or it can be triggered by getting injured mid-battle. You cannot stop berserking before the battle is over, and while berserking you will always attack the closest enemy available.

7.5 _Weapons training_: you gain +1 to AC when using a weapon with longer reach than your opponent; you gain +1 to hit when using a lighter weapon than your opponent; you roll d8s for damage when using a two-handed weapon; you gain +1 initiative when attacking with ranged weapon unhindered.

7.6 _Spear training_: when using a spear, you gain +1 to hit, and +2 to AC against opponents with shorter reach than you.

7.7 _Longsword training_: when using a longsword, you gain +1 AC against opponents with shorter reach than you, and you gain one advantage die on your damage rolls.

7.8 _Bow training_: when using a bow, taking an extra action only costs you 5 initiative points, and you may do so any round in which you act before all your opponents.
