<h2>2. Rewards and experience</h2>
2.1 Any coins, jewels, trinkets, and objects made of precious metals that can easily be sold or melted down count as treasure for the purpose of XP rewards. Artwork, rugs, objects of cultural significance or objects of high craftsmanship that can be sold do tooâ€”as long as the sale price is predicated mostly on other things than practical value. Regular weapons, building materials etc. do not count for XP, even if the characters make a fortune hauling them back.

2.2 Magic items and the like count as treasure for XP purposes only if they are sold at the end of the adventure in which they were recovered. If a character holds on to a particular item for another adventure, they will never be able to claim XP for its sale later on.

2.3. Characters also get XP for monetary rewards and gains from their adventures. Even something as mundane as leading a trade caravan through hostile territory for a stake in the transported goods will give XP for the character's share in the profits. However, pure salaried positions (i.e. a fixed rate per day) don't give XP, even for dangerous or adventurous work such as bodyguards or soldiers.

2.4 Money and valuables taken or looted from mundane merchants, rulers or citizens do not count as being earned on an adventure.

2.5 Treasure must be brought to "civilization", or to a secure location, in order to give the XP reward. However, if the location is secure from the dangers of the adventure but financially insecure due to e.g. taxes or mundane thieves, the characters gain the XP even if they ultimately don't get to spend the money.

2.6 In addition to the basic unit of the silver piece, sp, we take a gold piece to be worth 50sp and a copper piece to be worth 1/10th of an sp. When running pre-published modules for other games with an XP-for-treasure rule similar to amendment IX, the GM is advised to look up what the treasure to XP conversion rate and the XP required per level were in the context it was originally published. Some games had 1 XP for 1gp, and some had 1gp be worth 10sp rather than 50. The GM can then adjust treasure finds accordingly ahead of play, so that the end result is a dungeon worth as much XP as originally intended.

2.7 In addition to the experience awarded for treasure, we also award a small amount for encountering and overcoming foes. This amount is 10 XP per hit die (1d6 HP, or closest equivalent) of the foes.

2.8 In some contexts, it makes sense to negotiate a different measure of success than treasure; also known as "quest XP". This should be done when something other than money takes on a similar role in that it motivating all characters goes almost without saying. Possible examples might include saving a largely innocent populace from mortal peril, at a rate of 10 XP per person saved.

2.9 Unless otherwise noted, a character gains their second level at 1500 XP, and each subsequent level at double the XP total at which they gained their previous level (so at 3000, 6000, 12000 etc.). No XP is lost by gaining a level; the total just keeps going up.
