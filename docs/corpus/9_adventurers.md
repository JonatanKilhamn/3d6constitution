<h2>9. Adventurers</h2>

9.1 Adventures gain a re-roll on any d20 roll the player makes, usable as many times as the character's level per session.

<h3>Precedents for adventurer-exclusive initiations</h3>

9.2 _Circus acrobat_: you gain a bonus equal to your level to any checks that involve whole-body movement, contortionism and similar things. It works in combat, but only when doing swashbuckling-style moves instead of fighting like a reasonable personâ€”i.e. the difficulty of the check probably goes up as well.

9.3 _Prepared_: you may account for any undetermined medium-sized items in your pack when setting out on an expedition. Except when in direct danger, you can make a knowledge check, DC 20, to rifle through your pack and find that you happened to bring this thing you need right now. If it's costly, retroactively pay the money you must have used to buy it back in town.

9.4 _Keen eye_: you gain a bonus equal to your level to any checks involving searching for hidden things.
