Basically a limited version of the Sage's class ability. If a Sage took this initiation, the bonuses would probably stack.

10.2 _Patient trapper_: you are skilled at hunting animals with traps. When travelling the wilderness, you can reduce your overland speed by 25% to set traps as you go. If you return to the same area within three days, you may roll as if hunting, again reducing travelling speed by 25%, to empty the traps.

10.3 _Haggler_: when you have ample time to survey the market for the best deal on a particular thing, you may roll a d20. A result below your charisma score means you manage 10% off the listed price.
