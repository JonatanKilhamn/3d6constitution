<h2>11. Priests and blessings</h2>

11.1 An ordained priest can ask for the Lord's blessing over a person, place or item. The priest must specify his purpose: do they ask for the Lord's blessing to aid in their scourging of the undead, or for personal gain?

11.2 The prayers and rituals take about 30 minutes to complete, and the blessing lasts until one sunrise and one sunset has passed (in either order).

11.3 Asking for the Lord's blessing for a selfish or ungodly purpose, regardless of whether it is given, gives the priest one point of penance. Each point of penance counts as as point of fatigue for the purposes of hit point rolls.

11.4 Asking for the Lord's blessing for a just and good purpose, and then taking actions to fulfil that purpose, removes one point of penance.

11.5 When subject to the Lord's blessing, a character gets +1 to all checks and saves made in the course of pursuing the original purpose.

11.6 Undead creatures and demons are repelled by the Lord's blessing, and it is extra effective. The degree of this effect is determined by the level of the priest and the rank (HD) of the monster. For weaker priests and stronger undead, the only extra effect is defensive, like +1 to AC. At equal levels, the bonus can be +1 to damage dealt. Weaker undead could be warded off completely by a high-level priest, unable to touch the blessed at all.
