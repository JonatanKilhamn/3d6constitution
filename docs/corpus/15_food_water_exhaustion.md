<h2>15. Food, water and exhaustion</h2>

15.1 Food and water is counted (separately) in rations. Every character needs one ration of food and one ration of water per day to function normally.

15.2 Going without food for 12 hours means you're fasting, and take a -2 penalty to all checks. One can fast indefinitely, keeping the -2 but otherwise fully functional, as long as they eat at least half a ration every 24 hours. To end a fast, they must eat normal rations for as many days as the fast lasted, up to a maximum of a month.

15.3 A character who is fasting can go further, into a state of starvation. This happens after strength/3 days of strain (minimum 1). This "clock" counting up to three resets only when fasting ends. Going completely without food, or physically exerting oneself while fasting, both count as one day of strain. These effects accumulate, so going without any food while exerting oneself counts as two days of strain at once.

15.4 When starving, each day of strain gives another -2 penalty to all checks, adding to the one already given by fasting. Starvation ends after eating normally for as many days as the starvation lasted; the character then returns to a state of fasting which in turn ends after eating normally for as many days as the pre-starvation fasting lasted.

15.5 Going without water for a day requires a Strength save against DC 20. On a success, the character takes a -4 penalty to all checks (just like the food-related penalties); on a failure, they get a -6 penalty. Drinking water (one and a half ration) resets this penalty. If they fail three such checks before drinking their fill, they die.

15.6 Going without sleep gives a -4 exhaustion penalty to all checks per 24-hour period starting after the first. Sleeping well removes this penalty completely, and sleeping unwell brings it to -2. As long as the character has any exhaustion penalty, staying awake when sitting or lying down requires a Will check at DC 25 each exploration turn.

15.7 If a character racks up a combined total penalty from fasting, starvation, dehydration and sleep deprivation as big as half their Strength score, their overland speed is halved, and they start each day with one point of fatigue (which means they have one disadvantage die on their morning HP roll). If it reaches their full Strength score, they have to make an injury save (DC 20) per day.
